# Awesome Canadian Robotics

A curated list of Canadian robotics open-source software, compagnies and researchers.
The maintenance of this list is aligned with the proposition of the [Canadian Robotics Council](https://www.roboticscouncil.ca) to better share information about robotics initiative in Canada.
This is not a comprehensive list of everything happening in Canada related to robotics.
We added abitrary criterias to be listed here with the intention to be transparent.

## Open-Source Software

You need at least 15 stars on your repository to be listed here.
The list is sorted by number of stars.

- [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher?style=social)](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/stargazers) [libpointmatcher](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher): An Iterative Closest Point (ICP) library for 2D and 3D mapping in Robotics. [Norlab](https://norlab.ulaval.ca) is maintaining and using the library for their research on autonomous navigation in harsh environments.
- [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/norlab-ulaval/wiln?style=social)](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/wiln/stargazers) [Weather Invariant Lidar-based Navigation (WILN)](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/wiln): A lidar-based Teach-and-Repeat framework designed to enable outdoor autonomous navigation in harsh weather. [Norlab](https://norlab.ulaval.ca) is maintaining and using the framework to deploy mobile robots in harsh weather, recently featured in [Kilometer-scale autonomous navigation in subarctic forests: challenges and lessons learned](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/publications/field-report-ltr/).
- [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/utiasASRL/vtr3?style=social)](https://github.com/utiasASRL/vtr3/stargazers) [VT&R3](https://github.com/utiasASRL/vtr3): VT&R3 is a C++ implementation of the Teach and Repeat navigation framework. It enables a robot to be taught a network of traversable paths and then closely repeat any part of the network.  [utiasASRL](https://utiasasrl.github.io/) is maintaining and using the package for their research on vision-based localization algorithms in outdoor environments.
- [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nickcharron/lidar_snow_removal?style=social)](https://github.com/nickcharron/lidar_snow_removal/stargazers) [lidar_snow_removal](https://github.com/nickcharron/lidar_snow_removal): This repo is a set of nodes for ROS to filter point clouds with the goal of removing snow in Lidar data. [TrailLAb](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/) was maintaining this package for their publications on the [Canadian Adverse Weather Dataset](http://cadcd.uwaterloo.ca/).
