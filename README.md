# Awesome Canadian Robotics

A curated list of Canadian robotics open-source software, compagnies and researchers.
The maintenance of this list is aligned with the proposition of the [Canadian Robotics Council](https://www.roboticscouncil.ca) to better share information about robotics initiative in Canada.
This is not a comprehensive list of everything happening in Canada related to robotics.
We added abitrary criterias to be listed here with the intention to be transparent.
