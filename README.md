# Awesome Canadian Robotics

A curated list of Canadian robotics open-source software, compagnies and researchers.
The maintenance of this list is aligned with the proposition of the [Canadian Robotics Council](https://www.roboticscouncil.ca) to better share information about robotics initiative in Canada.
This is not a comprehensive list of everything happening in Canada related to robotics.
We added abitrary criterias to be listed here with the intention to be transparent.

## Open-Source Software

You need at least 15 stars on your repository to be listed here.
The list is sorted by number of stars.

- [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher?style=social)](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher/stargazers) [libpointmatcher](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher): An Iterative Closest Point (ICP) library for 2D and 3D mapping in Robotics. [Norlab](https://norlab.ulaval.ca) is maintaining and using the library for their research on autonomous navigation in harsh environments.
